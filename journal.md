## 25-Mar-21 : N hasn't uttered a word
Despite multiple repetitions of words for various items he hasn't
respondeded at all. 

N2 is enjoying is more. He liked it so much that he has started
hopping on my lap.

## 24-Mar-2021 : Starting on N's activities
We are not being proactive, of-course we fall in the survival
category. I think the scale of the problem hasn't dawned on us yet.
We need to buck up. We are vocalizing a lot more than before. 

Sometimes when I repeat the names by pointing at it, I loose N's
attention. 

<mark>Go! I am trying that.</mark> Putting him on my lap then point
at it
